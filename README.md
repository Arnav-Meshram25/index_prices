# index_prices

First of all we import the required libraries. Pandas to deal with csv data. Tkinter for developing Graphical User Interface.
Matplotlib for the bar graph. IO to process the csv values provided.

The left panel holds a list of indices. When one of them is selected the bar graph depicts the movement of the index price on a day, covering data such as opening price , closing price , highest price , lowest price of the index during the day. More information such as P/B ratio,turnover and volume traded are depicted on the right panel. Dark theme is used for better user experience.
